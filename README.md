# AES-RSA
Developed a system that combines AES and RSA encryption to ensure secure data transmission. The system encrypts data using AES-128 in ECB mode and employs RSA-1024 for securing the AES encryption keys. This project demonstrates knowledge in generating an RSA private/public key pair and integrating it with AES-128 to encrypt and decrypt messages.
